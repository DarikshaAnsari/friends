# Chainloop

Chainloop is an open-source software supply chain control plane, a single source of truth for artifacts plus a declarative attestation crafting process.

Chainloop provides a CLI tool that can be used to generate `in-toto` attestations wrapped in a signed [DSSE](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/dsse) envelope from any CI/CD system.
