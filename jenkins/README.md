# Jenkins

Jenkins is a popular open source automation server used for CI/CD operations.
As CI/CD systems are a key component in software supply chains, securing them
is vital. The in-toto team maintains a plugin for Jenkins that can be used to
generate in-toto metadata pertaining to a particular build or "job".
