# SolarWinds

SolarWinds is an American company that provides information technology services
and software to other companies and government agencies. In December 2020,
FireEye revealed that SolarWinds had been the victim of a software supply chain
attack dubbed SUNBURST. Specifically, their build infrastructure was
compromised to inject malicious code into a product called Orion.

After this incident came to light, SolarWinds revamped their build
infrastructure. Dubbed Project Trebuchet, the system makes use of several
features such as reproducible builds to validate the results of a build, and
in-toto to attest to the results and provenance of a build.
